A Background Subtraction Library

[![bgslibrary](http://i.giphy.com/5A94AZahSIVOw.gif)](https://youtu.be/_UbERwuQ0OU)

Last Page Update: **12/03/2017**

Latest Library Version: **1.9.2** (see [Release Notes](https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary/wiki/Release-notes) for more info)

The **BGSLibrary** was developed by [Andrews Sobral](http://andrewssobral.wixsite.com/home) and provides an easy-to-use C++ framework based on [OpenCV](http://www.opencv.org/) to perform foreground-background separation in videos. The bgslibrary compiles under Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X. Currently the library contains **37** algorithms. The source code is available under [GNU GPLv3 license](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), the library is free and open source for academic purposes. 

Note: the BGSLibrary is based on OpenCV 2.X, if you want to use with OpenCV 3.x please check-out our [opencv3](https://github.com/andrewssobral/bgslibrary/tree/opencv3) branch.
